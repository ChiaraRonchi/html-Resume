    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> I am a professional with solid experience of three years in the hospitality industry, having held roles as a front-desk and back-office agent. My university education in English and German languages has enriched my profile with linguistic skills, which I have promptly put into practice during this most recent experience.
        </p>
        <p> Over the years as a receptionist, I have always stood out for my strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and care for the customer. Additionally, my ability to work in a team has always been evident, allowing me to ensure efficient synergy in the quick resolution of daily issues and stress management.
        </p>
        <p> Currently, I am engaged in an experience abroad in Spain, aimed at enhancing my language skills, and at the same time, I am looking for a professional opportunity that will allow me to take on additional responsibilities upon my return to Italy in December. I am open to new challenges as I wish to enrich my professional experience and contribute significantly to the success of the company that will trust in my skills and ambitions.
